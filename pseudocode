struct
  n = number of candidates
  array[n] of names of candidates
  array[m][n] of ballots 

read()
  input is std input format
  output is pointer array of structs

eval() 
  intput is struct pointer
  output is int winner id

solve()
  input is std input


maybe printing helper

read ()
  read in case
  output array of structs with number of cases, 
  array of candidates, array of ballots

eval ( struct pointer)
  vote_array[n] number of each candidates votes
  still_in_the_race[n]  

  while( !win or lose conditions )
    for i in m
    j=0
    while( !still_in_the_race[ballot_array[i][j]] ) j++
    vote_array[ballot_array[i][j]]++
    eliminate

solve (r, w)
  get the number of cases

  read() to parse data return array
  for every struct in array
    eval()
    output winner(s)
